The main objectives of this project are for teams to:
1.	Practice pushing ML models “to the limit” by exploring different techniques in preprocessing and cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, data augmentation, ML algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembles.
2.	Learn the effect of building a model on one dataset and testing it on another.
3.	Practice splitting a complicated project amongst themselves in a tight timeline.
